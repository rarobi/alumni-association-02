                            <p>Sustainable development is focusing on creating and implementing processes, systems, programs and practices vital in protecting the natural environment. Based on the concept of Growald (2010), responsible use and protection of the natural world is without question essential to sustainability. Likewise, he emphasized that sustainability is not just living, thriving, or an environmental issue, but is a human issue. The call for sustainable development requires formulating alternative solutions that give emphasis on reducing resource utilization, minimizing waste, observing teal purchasing policy, preventing pollution, tealing structures and buildings and continuously improving teal environmental programs.</p>
                            <p>CHMSCâ€™s vision is teal CHMSC Excels (Excellence, Competence and Educational Leadership in Science and Technology) focusing on teal sustainable development (CHMSC Five-Year Development Plan). The drive of everyone in the College should be directed by this vision. Moreover, one of the research agenda of the College is concentrated on climate change and teal and clean technology (CHMSC Research Manual) which is relevant to the present study. Achieving sustainable development is one of the major concerns of the world today. Countries are focusing on how to maintain and preserve the natural environment that future generations could also experience and enjoy living in it. Different organizations and individuals have great responsibility to realize it. However, the course towards sustainable development entails effective management and high commitment of all participants. It involves clear and concrete vision and positive values.</p>
